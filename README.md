# Smile-on-Face-detector
A small .py script that detects faces and smiles in realtime

# How to make it work
Hopefully you have your python environment set up, so all you need to do is download the script with the Frontal Face and Smile cascade (.xml) files and add it to the same folder as the smiley_face.py script.
And Voila!
Just open your terminal and just "python smiley_face.py" and press enter!
