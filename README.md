# Smile-on-Face-detector
A small .py script that detects faces and smiles in realtime

# How to make it work
Hopefully you have your python environment set up, so all you need to do is download the script with the Frontl Face and Smile cascade (.xml) files.
And Voila!
Just open your terminal and just "python smiley_face.py" and press enter!
